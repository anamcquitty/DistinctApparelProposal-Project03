# Plan
## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
### Sequence activities
1. **Planning**
- When planning I used my precvious assignment to chart what was staying and going from my project and adjusted it accordingly. This lead to the continued inspiration and creation of the project itself.
2. **Repository Setup**
- For the repository setup, I created a repository with an embeded README.md file.
- I created a new "docs" folder.
- in the docs folder placed the three different required items: plan.md, scope.md, retrospective.md.
3. **Documentation**
- In the scope.md section I wrote a few things to address the feedback provided to me and copying it all on to this form.
- In the plan.md file we are doing exatly that right now. A major plan for the entire process of the project, including detailed sections and bullets describing each and every step.
- Finally, the retroscpedic.md which will be used to reflect on the project overall. I chose to do this one towards the end because it is overviewing positives, negatives, and other information that I might not have before the project is finished.
4. **Websites**
I procedded to add the websites which consisted of a two page website that uses HTML and CSS basics learned in class. With the skills learned, I created the website with information about the brand, product descriptions and more.
5. **Reviewing Work**
- I ensured all the links were working.
- I ensured information was accurate.
- I ensure the information included was the correct one, and met standards.
- And lastly, I checked that everything was included and flowed smoothly.

### Identify and assign people 
This was a solo assignment so there was no one to assign any task to. Hoever, if the task are hypothetical and in relation to the fictional business, then the design would be assigned to a visual design team. The execusion would be worked on by all members of the team. The additional duties might be designated to someone like an intern so they can get their feet wet. And ultimately, the launcher of this project would be the person who presented the idea. In this case that would be me.
### Estimate the duration of each activity
For each activity, I might say it would take about 2-3 days to complete that includes brainstorming, rough drafts, executions, approval, editing, and launch. Though, it would take probably only a day to a few hours for the launch. Wheras the creative team might take a few days longer for photography, recruiting of people, etc.
### Identify the critical path
I believe the critical path for this project would be to launch a starting business, that becomes loved and cherished by its customers. This would be made up of visuual design, cleanliness, organization, and satisfaction.

## TAME
Some risks we might encounter are:
- Website crash.
- Missleading or wrong information.
- Non-clean looking appearance.
Basically, anything that is listed in the desired outcomes.
#### Transfer
Something we could shift the risk of a possible crash or missinformation is the closing of the website. This can be done to shift the stress of figuring it out at the very moment if it is unknown where the issue is rooted in.
#### Accept
Acceptance is obviously a good part if used correctly. SOmething that could be done is a letter stating that the error will be solved soon or/and apologize for said mistake. Offer comfort and great rewsources.
#### Mitigate
A way to mitigate can be by allowing more people to cross examine and ensure everyone is double checking before enabling a mistake. Maybe making the groups a smaller party, thaat could work as well.
#### Eliminate
Removing the risk of any of the bad stuff from happening is crucial. So as mentioned in "Mitigate" this would be double checking everyhthing and facing the possible challege head on.
