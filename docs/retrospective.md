# Retrospective
#### What was done well?
Something I think was done well was the organization. I believe it was a well organized project. I think that is one of the most crucial thingas to have when executing a major project.
#### What needs to be done better or differently?
I think that time would need to be managed better. This would allow for growth room. Maybe something later on, that was thought of, that could have been perfect for the project and perfecting it.
#### What unexpected risks did we have to deal with? 
There wasn't really too many unexpected risk, but it there was some struglle when finally attempting to launch the project because of small missing things.
#### How does our project management process need to change to meet future goals?
It definitely has to be managed with better time, as mentioned before. It can also be maybe a little more detailed. It never hurts to have an extra detail, because if this were an official website, customers would enjoy if you can know exactly what they are looking for and at.
