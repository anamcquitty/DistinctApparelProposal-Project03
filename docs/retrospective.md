# Retrospective
#### What was done well?
Something I think was done well was the organization. I believe it was a well organized project. I think that organization is one of the most crucial things to have when executing a major project.
#### What needs to be done better or differently?
I think that time would need to be managed better. This would allow for growth room. Maybe something later on, that was thought of, that could have been ideal for the project and could have perfected it.
#### What unexpected risks did we have to deal with? 
There wasn't really too many unexpected risk, but there was some struggle when finally attempting to launch the project website because of missing components and user error.
#### How does our project management process need to change to meet future goals?
It definitely has to be managed with better time, as mentioned before. It can also be a little more detailed. It never hurts to have an extra eye on the samll things to improve, because if this were an official website, customers would enjoy that attention to detail, little things that might ease or elevate their experience.
