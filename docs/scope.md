# Final Project Scope Statement  
## Project 03 – Clothing Brand

## Project Name  
**Distinct.** – A classic clothing brand with a modern twist and online store prototype.  

## Project Purpose  
This project will use a fictional clothing brand to create a two-page website prototype outlining a few differnet clothing items and their looks. This will depict the key features learned in the PMUPM Chapter 3 by showcasing the different use of organization, creativity, and adaptability. This project is being created to push me to manage a project and use the skills that I learned in class. In a fictional manner this is being made to prommote a new brand through their first drop of clothes. To draw people into the brand for style, freedom, and joy.

## Description  
This project will create a professional, visually appealing two-page website for **Distinct**, a fashion brand that has the perfect balance of modern elegance and  timeless fashion.  
- **Home Page (pg. 1):** For the home page there will be a banner among other elements thst will welcome the customers. This page will keep the viewer engaged and will also display a little bit about the brand and how it came to be.  
- **Product Display (pg. 2):** A product display page will include products and their decriptions, along with prices and images describing the products.  

This will all be tracked using a GitHub Repository amd will be completed with _HTML_ and _CSS_.

## Desired Results  
I hope that for this project I am able to incorporate the use of all the new skills learned in this class while incorporating the Unofficial Project Manager skills learned in the PMUPM chapters. I hope that this website becomes the foundation or something I keep in the back of my mind when creating new projects and accepting new challenges by being an example of what I am capable of creating. I also hope that it will demonstrate a successfull wwebsite that can mimic the features of a real world website. As reviewed, a more measurable approach I can add to my desired results is that it lands me a better grade, and a great turnout in sales. Something like, selling out of a product that is being sold as well as good reviews.

## Exclusions  
- This cannot include any form of capturing payment, anything that might cause someone to be able to actually "shop" on the site or might entice someone to provide personal information. 
- Nothing that will show that might drag down the websites integrity.
- Nothing that might desrespect others and their opinions or discriminate.
- Nothing that might make the website appear _cheap_.

## Priorities  
- **High Priority:** It is important that the website appear clean and appealing to the eye, nice product design and creativity.  
- **Medium Priority:** Responsive layout for viewing.  
- **Low Priority:** Advanced features that are not within my scope.   

## Acceptance Criteria  
- The projects progress will be tracked through/with a GitHub repository with all planning and coding files. This project must have a clean look to it and has to use the foundations taught in the PMUPM book and showcase growth and understanding of these topics.
